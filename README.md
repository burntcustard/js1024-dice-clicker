> A rat-assisted dice-clicking [js1024](https://js1024.fun/) entry inspired by [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) and [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html).

### How to play

- Click the dice on the left to start producing "dots", and then spend those dots in the shop on the right.
- There is no major objective or endgame, but you could consider purchasing the most expensive item in the shop, the ‚öÖ^‚öÖ dice, the goal.

### Known issues
- The rat emoji (üêÄ) displays very differently on different devices.
- The dice are _very_ wonky on some devices due to the (lack of centering) of the ‚öÖ character.
